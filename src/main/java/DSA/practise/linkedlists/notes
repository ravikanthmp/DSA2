LinkedLists :
   Sequential list of nodes with a head pointer

   Used in
    ADT implementations for List, Queue, Stack
    Hash Table with chaining
    Graph Adjacency list

   Types
                    Pro                         Cons
     Singly -   Simpler to implement    Cannot reach prev node
     Doubly -   More use-cases          2x memory
                such as add/remove in
                O(1)
